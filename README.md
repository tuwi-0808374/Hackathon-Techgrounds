# Hackathon Techgrounds

## Descrition
LangBridge is an app designed to facilitate collaboration between people who speak different languages. Users can communicate in their native language while the app translates their messages in real time for others. This helps eliminate language barriers in diverse teams.

The project utilized local AI models instead of online services, with Ollama running on a laptop for greater control and privacy. This approach required extra setup time but provided deeper insights into AI implementation.

The app was built using Node.js and JSC, rather than Python, to accommodate team members with different programming skill sets. The development process involved quickly adapting to a new syntax and integrating translation functionalities efficiently.

During the hackathon, the team participated in workshops, including one on pitching, to refine their communication skills and prepare for the final presentation.
